#COM522 F E T for Multimedia 

##'Emerging Technology'

Emerging from research advances 

Emerging into society 

May already be applied but may not be available 

Will start to replace the state-of-the-art soon 

##'Future Technology' 

Currently being researched and thought about 

Not applied beyond an experimental stage 

May start to emerge at some point in the future 

May never emerge 

* Check out 'Google Scholar' 
* Tech blogs NGadget 
* Google IO & Apple Developer Events 
* CES Coverage, consumer technology but blue sky's thinking sessions for more 'out' there themes 

---

* May not always be explicity multimedia in nature 

* Maybe indirectly supporting aspects of Multimedia
