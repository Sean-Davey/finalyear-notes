#COM522 F E T for Multimedia 

##'Emerging Technology'

Emerging from research advances 

Emerging into society 

May already be applied but may not be available 

Will start to replace the state-of-the-art soon 

##'Future Technology' 

Currently being researched and thought about 

Not applied beyond an experimental stage 

May start to emerge at some point in the future 

May never emerge 

* Check out 'Google Scholar' 
* Tech blogs NGadget 
* Google IO & Apple Developer Events 
* CES Coverage, consumer technology but blue sky's thinking sessions for more 'out' there themes 

---

* May not always be explicity multimedia in nature 

* Maybe indirectly supporting aspects of Multimedia 


## Assessment: 

Select a FET topic of relevance to multimedia 

Investigate it thoroughly 

Report your finding 

Mash and combine technologies for a title and structure 

And report your findings 

## Deliverables 

Select three topics and provide a rationale 

Use Citing webpage for sources 

Make use of up-to-date publications 

Include information on underlying scientific advances of each 

Acknowledge all sources of information appropriately 

Arrage and attend supervision sessions 

Due by Friday 22 Feburary before 17:00 on blackboard (worth 20%)

---

Final product (80%) 

Due 19th April 



## Getting Started 

Wearable and inbedded technologies 

HCI, Eye tracking, guester control 

Affective Computing, chatbots, emotional computing

Ambient Intelligence, Chris Nugent, 

Pervasive Computing, interfaces everywhere, smart mirror, alexa's everywhere 

IOT, AI, Machine Learning. 

A topic more specififc than these.

`Examples to help identify suitable topics` 

* Haptic interfaces 

- Limit a page on each topic 
- Sub-topics can be within each topic 
- Advantages / Disadvantages ?
- Reference research, proper citing 

## Week 5 


- First Deadline 	

Title 
What it is / review
Why it's an emerging technology 

* Full Report 

`Research the topic :` 

- Tech news sources 
- Peer reviewed research article database (Don't try to understand the whole paper, just the feel for it)
- Library resources 
- Parent Databases 
- Citation and referencing advice 
- Other suitable sources you identify 


`Two types of reports:` 

- Full description of technology 
- Review paper, graphics, haptic, sound

- Third person and critical of technology

`Full report structure:` 

* What the technology is / introduce it in some context 
* How it works, under the surface (details)
* What it does for multimedia (can explore but not necessary) 
* Legal, ethical, social, and professional implications 
* Compare to current technologies
* What's the advantages and disadvantages of it 
* How it moves things forward, what does it change / whats its impact 
* Evaluation

`Review based report:` 

* Place each technology in context 
* Shallower in detail but more breadth 
* Compare the technologies to eachother or competing technologies 


`Guidance:` 

* You are reporting knowledge not generating it 
* Understanding in your words 
* Para-phrase quotes and combine them from multiple sources 

`Level of detail:` 

* Single topic - more detailed than mini reviews

* Mini reviews - broader but still present detail in parts 

* Both should explain how the technology works 

`Reflection :` 

* What questions does the reader still have
* 2000 words ish 

`Submission :` 

* SeanDaveyB00695295.pdf 

* First page should be name, b-code and title 

* Then report body 

* And references

[Methods of BCI Interaction:](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225992971_Brain-Computer_Interfacing_and_Games page 10) 

* Tracking Eye Movement 
* Brain Signals / Frequency - Aplha, Beta, Gamma and mu-rhythm

Invasive vs Non-Invasive BCI's implants vs non implants

* MicroTransponder - Vagus (Neck) Nerve Simulator

[Paired with the game Bravemind to simulate war in Iraq & Afghanistan to help alleviate PTSD in army veterans](https://www.factor-tech.com/roundup/this-week-facial-recognition-used-to-capture-fugitive-spacex-commits-to-city-to-city-rocket-travel-and-uk-reveals-it-launched-a-cyber-attack-on-islamic-state/)


* BrainCo 

- Aim on developing an SDK for horror themed games which render environments where players emotional responses highten (fear) through brainwave tracking, 'horror games that learn from you'
