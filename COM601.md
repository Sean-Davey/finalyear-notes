#COM601 Rich Internet Application Development 


## Week 1 | Induction 

JQuery module, get 'Head First JQuery' textbook and read up to page 24 by week 2. 

Module focused on JQuery, AJAX, JSON, the DOM, NodeJS.

2 Assignments: 

* Assignment 1 - Individual project focusing on data retrieval for car insurance.
* Assignment 2 - Group project, developing a contact address book.

## Week 2 | JQuery Overview 

### this 

An object who's value is dependent on the line or scope of the javascript where it is executed.

### Object 

An action performed on an array, string, variable, tranformative.

### $() 

Shortened version of an invocation of a JQuery function : $() = jQuery()

Request and Responses (RESTFUL)

Cover up to page 100 of HFJQuery.

CRUD - 'Create, Read, Update, Delete' 

Look into YeNope - as a JQuery fallback 

## Week 3

HFJQuery Notes - 

* Asynchronous 

sequencing is important, can result in the difference between broken and working methods. 

Selector => Event => Function 

* Binding 

If the DOM element already exists a click method can be added to it, if the element is yet to be rendered methods can be binded to it


### Assignment 1 Catchup 

- JSON data should be read by AJAX function and processed.

- LocalStorage > Cookies to demonstrate how a return user is being recognised after they have accepted the user agreement. 

- Form fields should be prefilled for username and password, which in turn after 'logging in' further fields will be populated with the JSON data. 

- Remove the 'https' from external scripts to prevent the University firewall from blocking functionality. 


Do not mix HTML with Javascript (Obtrusive JS)

Event Bubbling (Window => Screen => Body => Element)

## Week 4 

AJAX method in combination with JQuery methods such as getScript can return JSON data and provide fallbacks and callbacks for interruptions such as:

- Timeouts
- Success
- Fail 
- Loading 

## Week 5 

Re-introduction to Node.JS, how SCSS and JS can be minified (very high level explanation) Assignment 1 completed. 

## Week 6 

Re-introduction to Node.js, terminal, Gitlabs, group allocations for Assignment 2. 

## Week 7

Assignment 2 should inform the marker of the project of the information being retrieved at each stage through process logs, both in the temrinal and being console.log'd / console.di. 

Changes made to the data being returned don't need to be reflected in the JSON file, only client side. 

The automation processes that we setup should be detailed both in the report and screencast. 

If it makes sense to automate with Node with a process then do it.
