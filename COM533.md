# COM533 Advanced Web Applications

* Progressive Web App with offline functionality - local storage / service workers 

* NewsAPI go above and beyond brief with worldwide news and other content area's etc

 --
 
 For assignment dont include all fields from API, only required ones 
 
 
 
 * $sql = "DELETE FROM staff WHERE Staff_Id=:id";
 
 $app->post 
 
 PUT - Update 
 POST - New 
 
* "UPDATE staff SET Firstname=firstname, Lastname=:lasname, Campus=:campus WHERE Staff_Id=:id"

--

## REST API DESIGN RULEBOOK 



* POST - Staff / creates new staff 

* GET - Staff / get's all of the 'staff'

* PUT - Staff / updates the current 'staff' 

* DELETE - Staff / deletes the 'staff' data / entries 


VICE VERSA : 


TADA XD

Swagger - documentation tool for API's 

Any-Api.com

NewsApi.org 
 
## Week 4 

News content area's can be decided, not strictly following the brief 

different content arent each an AJAX call, array of conditional searches 

Store offline, but search for duplicates 



'loadData' keyword for API online search 



## OOP's I did it again 

- Encapsulation 
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction (not applicable to Javascript) 

- Defining constructor parametres inside function e.g 

### Encapsulaton: 

function DoSomething(these, are, public) 
{

this.these = "foo";
this.are = "foo";
this.public = "foo";
private = "private";

}

^ Above can be accesed outside of this functions scope 


###Â Inheritance 


Look into .prototype for functions

### Polymorphism 

Many different forms, essentially overiding variables, methods, etc 

### Week 5 

JQuery templates 

`<script id="whatev" type="text/x-jQuery-tmpl">`

{{if}}
<img src={picture} alt="jgjh">
{{else}}
<img src={default.png} alt="jgjh">
{{/if}}

</script>


Inside JQuery file 

document.ready 

$("staff_tmpl").tmpl(staffData).appendTo("idName);


## Overview of JQuery Templates 

{{each ModuleName}} <element>{$value}</element> {{/each}}

## Class Test 1 

Weeks 1-6 summary 

- Advantages & disadvantages of RIA's 

- Optimisation, HTML, CSS, JS, IMAGES (Less about the class test, moreso assignment)

- PWA's ( Basics and & concept, BIG OOF, not on test, not req for assignment)

- REST, 3 main parts, interaction between those, & constraints, how to design 

- OOP, editable objects, methods, how to create object, class & constructors, how to put a method and properties on an object, equality operators, === etc and encapsulation & inheritance 

- JQuery templates, the tags &{}, {{else}}, {{HTML}} etc 


### Test Information 

- 11 questions, multiple choice, 1 mark, fill in the blanks, 5-10, short answer 6 marks 


### GIT 

Mention git in report for MP

### Week 7 (Test 2) 

Semantic Web 

- Web 1.0, 2.0, 3.0

- Vocabulary / Ontology

- Examples and challenges of the semantic web

## Week 8 - Semantic Web 

RDF (Resource Description Framework) 

* Defines a 'Graphical Database' 

* RDF Triples: 

- Subject, Predicate, Object 



### Ontologies 

The theories of data-sets 

Why develop an Ontology:

'To share common understanding of the structure of information among people and machines' 

- Enables reuse of domain knowledge 
- Makes domain assumptions explicit 
- Seperates domain knowledge from operational knowledge 
- To analyse domain knowledge 




### Week 9 

- Week 11 will likely be a revision class 

- RDF Schema 

- Recap: 

* Subject  - The resource in question 
* Predicates - A term used to describe or modify a part of the subject 
* Object - The target or 'value' 


Possible Example Question: 

'Ric's blog can be found at ricRoberts.com' 

#### Ric is the subject, blog is the predicate & 'ricRoberts.com' is the object


### Week 10

- METADATA: 

- DC: Dublin Core, Metadata standard 
- There are 15 elements for describing resources 

3 main elements : 

- Content, Intellectual Property, Instantiation

### Example Questions: 


- Ontologies : which of the following would be described as a class: 
- Country 
- france
- Europe
- Population 

- Open ended questions require a short paragraph (worth around 3-4 marks) 

- Defenitions, Graphs

- RDF Triples  classes and properties

- SPARQL Fixing query questions

## Semantic Web Services 

- Definition and Parts 

- SOAP, Need, Advantages, Disadvantages, Structure, Fault and Success Messages

- WSML
