# COM559 Major Project 


## Week 1

Module centered around producing a product that is interactive, accompanied by a database and / or server side scripting.

Report to accompany - 60 pages max plus appendices. 

Presentation, Demonstration and questioning by a panel of educators. 

* Mentors : Feedback every 2 weeks. 

* Peer Support Groups : Helpful for reviewing progress and assistance with a varied group of people from different expertise / placement years.

* Major Project must follow BCS Guidelines 

* Deadlines: Lower fidelity at first, then begins to gain structure as we go, begin rapid prototyping / brainstorming for ideas NOW. 


What makes a good project: 

 - Interactivity 
 - Multiplatform / Device 
 - Mobile Apps (Progressive Web App?)
 - Combinaion of Visual Design and Technical Ability 

What the project should address: 

 - Needs to address a clearly identifiable problem 
 - Has to be a technical challenge 
 - The process is very important towards professional practice (detail it as you go along)


 Requirements: 

 Generate 3 concepts: 

 (Continually Iterate over the idea's generated, idea's can be changed anytime but be wary of time constraints)

 - Week 1 : Research 3 idea's 
 - Week 1 - 3 : Discuss with mentor and research 
 - Week 3 : Discuss and Submit concepts in a contextual report 

## Week 2

Begin to finalise project proposal forms in preparation for meeting with mentor next week. 

Form Requirements: 

* Concept Title - Sale Name / Theme 
* Concept Description - What does it offer? 
* Anticipated End Product - Features and Capabilities 
* Resources Required - Hard and Software 



## Week 3

### Scope 

Select a methodology appropriate to the product. 

Discuss the boundaries of the product, what it will include and what it wont for first draft of chosen idea: 

- Research undertaken and resources 
- Design and Development 
- User testing 
- Prototyping / Agile Sprints 
- Quality 
- Time & Cost (9ish months from start to completion)

## Week 4 

No Classes

- User Stories creation

- Volere Snow Cards 

- User Requirements 

## Week 5 

Human Centered Design (HCD)

Requirement building:

* User stories need to be added no matter the chosen methodology 

* Volere is useful for identifying user requirements and needs 

* High and low level use case diagrams 

* High level requirements + Functional requirements need to be defined as tasks: 

In Agile this means defining what 'Done' means, define a clear criteria to be met and tested. 

Keep User Centered Design in mind. 

### User Experience Design 

Ask users to use, not evaluate 

UX: Learn the common design principals and schemas. 

Develop User personas - potential users of the product to capture their needs, motivations, traits and possible expectations.

This helps to capture and design the core functionality of the product. 

Depict the context in which users will engage with your product, define the users situation and their goals to help establish use cases. 

* Where do we go from here? 

- Sketching
- Wireframing
- Mockups
- Paper Prototyping 
- Functional Prototypes 

(The sketch to design continium)

- 6ups : Generate 6 key concepts by sketching 
- Wireframe : Begin to develop user flow, functionality and behaviour (don't be afraid to annotate)
- Mockups : High Fidelity, begin to see the beginnings of what the finished product might look like (Stay Monocrome at first)
- Functional Prototype : Coded functionality and / or visual functionality i.e. sketchup 
- The design is a continous process but embrace at this early stage (before Christmas break)

## Week 6 


No Classes 

6ups and sketching. 


## Week 7

### System Design 

Identify and define your solutions structure and technologies 

Select and rationalise technologies 

Identify canditate technologies 

Compare and evaluate their suitability for your project 

Specify technologies you will use 

Justify your decisions 

### MVC 

Model: Represents knowledge, data and logic that models knowledge & should map directly to the owners understanding (Data)

View: Visual representation of the model (interface), presentation filter, highlights / supresses attributes & questions / messages model to get/ update data (Presentaion of Data)

Controller: Links the user to the rest of the system and controls the delivery of views, never changes or modifies the structure of the view, just calls them & protects views from how interactions are made (Control of Data)

### Database Design 

Entity Relationship Modeling 

- Intuitive data diagramming technique 
- Helps to identify database tables, fields and relationships 
- Can be complex but even high-level use can be helpful 
- Consider the design of other data structures in the system 


### Design Patterns 

(React) Componentization, grids, navigation, elements, mainly reusability

### System Design Chapeter Requirements 

- Diagram the system at various levels of detail 
- Identify, compare, evaulate and specify technologies
- Perhaps diagram software at a lower level 
- Consider the data your system will need to manage 
- Explore how useful low level design patterns are for later use 
- The relative importance of these is relative to the project 

## Week 8

System design report began 

## Week 9

### Risk Analysis 

- Identify the risks
- Explore potential risks 
- Not just generic : time, EC1 possible issues 
- Focus on specific risks: what will be difficult, unknowns, skill deficits, external resources that need to be secured 
- Describe. each risk in enough detail to understand it, i.e. implications to the project if it fails 

### Risk Control 

- Have a plan for what to do regarding each risk 
- Evaluate the severity 
- Plan how to moderate or remove each identified risk 
- Have a backup plan related to each risk 
- Document each and how they will be controlled 
- Prototyping + early system tests 


### Functional Prototype 

- Purpose to remove the high risk/s 
- A significant risk related to the project implementation and explore it 
- Related to a third part service that is required 
- Core feature or data structure (but not a login)
- Technology that is new to yourself that you plan to use 

### How To Prototype 
- Not a finished item 
- Focused on addressing a risk 
- Very rarely is the appearance of any significance this early 
- Prototype from an informed position, based on your research 
- Keep notes and allow for false starts and dead ends 

### Key Features of a good Prototype 
- State the risk being addressed
- Explain what you have done in response 

## Week 10 

- Risk identification document 

## Week 11

### Final Report Overview 

- Mention the risks that you are identifying and solving in the video 
- 40% ish worth of marks for first prototype 

- Draft report is everything before implementation, polish it so that it reads as connected material rather than pieces pasted in section by section
- Code chunks can be included in the report 
-
