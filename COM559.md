#COM559 Major Project 


##Week 1

Module centered around producing a product that is interactive, accompanied by a database and / or server side scripting.

Report to accompany - 60 pages max plus appendices. 

Presentation, Demonstration and questioning by a panel of educators. 

* Mentors : Feedback every 2 weeks. 

* Peer Support Groups : Helpful for reviewing progress and assistance with a varied group of people from different expertise / placement years.

* Major Project must follow BCS Guidelines 

* Deadlines: Lower fidelity at first, then begins to gain structure as we go, begin rapid prototyping / brainstorming for ideas NOW. 


What makes a good project: 

 - Interactivity 
 - Multiplatform / Device 
 - Mobile Apps (Progressive Web App?)
 - Combinaion of Visual Design and Technical Ability 

What the project should address: 

 - Needs to address a clearly identifiable problem 
 - Has to be a technical challenge 
 - The process is very important towards professional practice (detail it as you go along)


 Requirements: 

 Generate 3 concepts: 

 (Continually Iterate over the idea's generated, idea's can be changed anytime but be wary of time constraints)

 - Week 1 : Research 3 idea's 
 - Week 1 - 3 : Discuss with mentor and research 
 - Week 3 : Discuss and Submit concepts in a contextual report 

##Week 2

Begin to finalise project proposal forms in preparation for meeting with mentor next week. 

Form Requirements: 

* Concept Title - Sale Name / Theme 
* Concept Description - What does it offer? 
* Anticipated End Product - Features and Capabilities 
* Resources Required - Hard and Software 



##Week 3

###Scope 

Select a methodology appropriate to the product. 

Discuss the boundaries of the product, what it will include and what it wont for first draft of chosen idea: 

- Research undertaken and resources 
- Design and Development 
- User testing 
- Prototyping / Agile Sprints 
- Quality 
- Time & Cost (9ish months from start to completion)

##Week 4 

No Classes

- User Stories creation

- Volere Snow Cards 

- User Requirements 

##Week 5 

Human Centered Design (HCD)

Requirement building:

* User stories need to be added no matter the chosen methodology 

* Volere is useful for identifying user requirements and needs 

* High and low level use case diagrams 

* High level requirements + Functional requirements need to be defined as tasks: 

In Agile this means defining what 'Done' means, define a clear criteria to be met and tested. 

Keep User Centered Design in mind. 

### User Experience Design 

Ask users to use, not evaluate 

UX: Learn the common design principals and schemas. 

Develop User personas - potential users of the product to capture their needs, motivations, traits and possible expectations.

This helps to capture and design the core functionality of the product. 

Depict the context in which users will engage with your product, define the users situation and their goals to help establish use cases. 

* Where do we go from here? 

- Sketching
- Wireframing
- Mockups
- Paper Prototyping 
- Functional Prototypes 

(The sketch to design continium)

- 6ups : Generate 6 key concepts by sketching 
- Wireframe : Begin to develop user flow, functionality and behaviour (don't be afraid to annotate)
- Mockups : High Fidelity, begin to see the beginnings of what the finished product might look like (Stay Monocrome at first)
- Functional Prototype : Coded functionality and / or visual functionality i.e. sketchup 
- The design is a continous process but embrace at this early stage (before Christmas break)

##Week 6 


No Classes 

6ups and sketching. 


##Week 7
