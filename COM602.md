# COM602 Web Computer Graphics and Animation 


## Week 1

Module will cover the basics of SVG, Canvas, Unity, 3D Graphics, CSS Animation, Image data. 

Assignments / Tests: 

* Test 1 (25%) - Canvas, SVG, Image Data, CSS Animation
* Test 2 (25%) - Unity, 3D Graphics 
* Assignment (50%) - Open theme, should display mastering of chosen medium, followed by a 1000 word report and 2 minute screencast. 

## Week 2

Contrary to popular opinion this module is not a 'Games Module' 

Idea's generation for the assignment could include but is not limited to: 

* Data Visualation 
* D3 and Live Data performing graphical changes 
* Interactive Infographics 

The end result should exibit web, graphics and programming skills, open to frameworks and animation API's. 

## Week 3

Canvas - has the capabilities of flash, to create graphics on the fly through javascript and the canvas HTML5 element.

Canvas context, the canvas element itself and other attributes should be defined with variables in order to be controlled. 

## Week 4 

Animation Principles  - refer to Disney's definitions. 

## Week 5 

API's and real time data can be used to power SVG's, Canvas and others. 

## Week 6 

SVG without the scalability, polylines differences to polygons - don't need to connect start and end lines, has no fill.

Radius of circle element is equal to double the width.

SVG animate element is a thing. 

## Week 7

Unity - more than just a games physics engine
- VR 
- Empathy 
- Simulations and Interactive Experiences 

Suppots multiple platfoms, IOS, Web, Andoid, PC, Mac, Games Consoles
Written in Javascript and C#

MIT - The moral machine 

Prefab is a type of reuable asset (component) of the GameObject 

Unity positioning - 1 unit = 1 meter 

* Materials - colour and properties of an objects surface 
* Texture - an image mapped onto the objects surface 
* Shader is used to render the object 

## Week 8 

### Unity part 2

* Fixed update (type of functional update 'javascript')
* Everything in Unity has a base class of 'game object' 
* Every other object inherits game object 

* Movement calculated in metres (5*) = 5 metres per second 
* Vector Array = 3 numbers (x,y,z) or (r,g,b)
* Ridgidbody is a component that character physics are added to 

### Game Physics 

* Don't need to know the equations, just the terminology 
* E.G. Ridgid body, Velocity

* isKinematic (the object can influence other objects physics but other objects cannot effect it)

## Week 9 
### Unity Part 3 

For the physics options in Unity it's not necessary to know the in-depth definitions, just the terminology. 

### Theory Slides 

The minimum number of triangles needed to render a shape is edges - 2. 

Front to back rendering disadvantages - redundancy. 

Painters method background - foreground Z Fighting. 



## Week 10 

### End of 3D Graphics 


Shading programmes: 

- Flat
- Gouraud
- Phong


Euler Terminology 

- Roll - Z Rotation 
- Pitch - X Rotation 
- Yaw - Y Rotation 

Test - Unity, WebGL, 3D Graphics 


### WebGL
